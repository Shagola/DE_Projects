# END TO END DE PROJECT WITH APACHE SPARK AND DATABRICKS



## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Apache Spark and Databricks to perform data transformation and analysis on an IPL dataset.The steps include downloading the dataset, uploading it to AWS S3, loading it into a Spark DataFrame, transforming the data, and performing analysis and visualization. this project mainly focuses on writing the spark code




## Project Steps

1. **Download IPL Dataset:**
   - The dataset is downloaded from an online source and saved locally.
   - [IPL Dataset](https://data.world/raghu543/ipl-data-till-2017)
   - Save the dataset to the specified path: `path p17`.

2. **Upload to AWS S3:**
   - The dataset is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket for easy access and scalability.

3. **Load Dataset into Spark DataFrame:**
   - Using Databricks, the dataset is loaded from S3 into a Spark DataFrame for processing.
   - This is done using the following Spark code:
     ```python
     # Example code to load data from S3 into a Spark DataFrame
     df = spark.read.csv("s3a://your-bucket-name/path-p17/your-dataset.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
     ```

4. **Data Transformation:**
   - Various transformations are applied to clean and prepare the data for analysis.
   - Example transformations include filtering, aggregating, and joining datasets.

5. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Using Spark SQL and DataFrame operations, various analyses are performed.
   - Visualizations are created to understand and interpret the data better.
   - Example visualization code:
     ```python
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     # Example code for creating a plot
     plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
     plt.plot(data)
     plt.title("Sample Plot")
     plt.xlabel("X-axis")
     plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
     plt.show()
     ```
