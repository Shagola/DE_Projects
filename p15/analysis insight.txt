I tried to run some queries and derive insigths but before anything, this whole data is fake and that means,
 it wont be very realistic and many of things will be the same average, and wont make much sense 

so lets start with sales trends(how sales vary over time)
1)total sales by month
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(oi.total_price) AS total_sales
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

conclusion is varies a little but mainyl its around 200k per month
biggest was at 2002-08-01 (I will add visualisations next time)

2)Total sales by product
SELECT p.name, SUM(oi.total_price) AS total_sales
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

most money was generated by spring roll veg mini, the least was generated by beef wellington


now lets try now customer behaviour
1) Customer total orders and spending
SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS total_orders, SUM(oi.total_price) AS total_spent
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.email = o.user_email
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

jeremy smith was the one with most total_spent and most orders was made by alison alvarez
least money was spent by Parker king

2)Order frequency per customer
SELECT u.name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.email = o.user_email
GROUP BY u.name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;



----Product Performance
1)top 10 products by quantity sold
SELECT p.name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.name
ORDER BY total_quantity DESC
LIMIT 10;

the best sellers were shared between muffin Batt- blueberry passion and 
muffin Batt - carrot spice


2)Average rating and number of reviews per product
SELECT p.name, p.rating, p.numberOfReviews
FROM products p
ORDER BY p.rating DESC;

undoubted goat was Bagelers- cinn/brown sugar witht the rating of 4.97 and number of reviews 329



this is not finished it is just a demo and also the conclusions that I derived is not really insight and 
sometimes I was only shown 100 results and I will fix everything slowly
